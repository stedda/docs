we like docs and thats why we do this stuff

<br/>

This looks beautifull and i think `ðŸ“„ README.md` should remain there for a while...

25     ### ðŸ˜Ž Publishing Changes
26     
27     Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.
28     
29     You can also preview changes using PRs, which generates a preview link of the docs.
30     
31     Change something here now and see what happens
32     
33     #### Troubleshooting
34     
35     - Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
36     - Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json` and some other stuff....
```
